"Donors Nepal" is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of meeting the regular needs for high-quality human blood within a specific area. It serves as a simple asking and accepting platform to provide immediate help for those in a medical emergency. By connecting blood donors with those in need, Donors Nepal enhances efficiency and effectiveness in addressing urgent needs.
The system consists of a central repository containing various Blood Donors along with their associated details, which helps in managing medical emergencies. Users can register, search for nearby donors, and post blood requests. Those interested in becoming donors can submit a donor request form, which, upon admin approval, allows them to join the list of available donors.
The platform also offers services like Profile and History Management and membership registration with DN. It includes a location-based algorithm to ensure that the nearest donor is visible first on the user's homepage, facilitating the donation process and minimizing the time taken to find donors. This system positively influences public health and well-being by addressing blood shortages and encouraging community participation in blood donation.
